      # Install tools from elm-tooling.json, unless we restored them from
      # cache. yarn.lock and elm-tooling.json can change independently,
      # so we need to install separately based on what was restored from cache.
      # This is run even if we restored ~/.elm from cache to be 100% sure
      # node_modules/.bin/ contains links to all your tools. `elm-tooling
      # install` runs very fast when there’s nothing new to download so
      # skipping the step doesn’t save much time.
